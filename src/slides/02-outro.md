    Despite all that, breastfeeding rates globally remain low. 
</div>

<div class="slide">
    Only 43% of the world's newborns are put to the breast within 1 hour of birth and 40% of infants aged 6 months or less are exclusively breastfed. These numbers can be even worse in low-income and middle-income countries.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    Many new mothers are unable to breastfeed because they cannot overcome the difficulties faced when initiating breastfeeding. Some of this difficulties are the right position of the baby, cracked nipples, and misleading information.
