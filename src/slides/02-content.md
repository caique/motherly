    An estimated <strong>5.3 million children under age five died in 2018</strong>. <br />
    Roughly, <strong>more than half</strong> of those deaths occurred in developing countries.

<div class="slide">
    Considering that, the UN established the <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3</strong>: <em>Good Health and Well-being</em>.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    The target is, by 2030, <strong>end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age</strong>.

One possible solution for child mortality is <strong>breastfeeding</strong>!

    "Children who are breastfed for longer periods have <strong>lower infectious morbidity and mortality</strong> [...] than do those who are breastfed for shorter periods, or not breastfed."

    Despite all that, breastfeeding rates globally remain low. 
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <strong>Only 40% of infants aged 6 months or less are exclusively breastfed</strong>. These numbers can be even worse in low-income and middle-income countries.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    Many <strong>new mothers are unable to breastfeed</strong> because they cannot overcome the difficulties faced in the beginning, such as: the right position of the baby, cracked nipples, and misleading information.

    Breastfeeding is a very complex practice that involves more than just the mother and the baby.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    The <strong>support between women is powerful</strong>, therefore, <strong>mothers need to connect</strong>!

</div>

<div class="slide">
   <strong>Mothers try many ways to connect themselves</strong> seeking for support in this manner.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    There are Facebook groups about breastfeeding with<strong> thousands of women</strong>.
</div>

<div class="slide">
   In Brazil, I started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nutricaomaternoinfantilufmg/" target=_blank>Instagram</a> account to connect health professionals - like myself - with women in need of breastfeeding support. In a few months the account got around 280 followers, with no publicity.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    However, <strong>social networks are not build for breastfeeding content</strong>. This makes women uncomfortable and reduces their chances to share experiences and provide support.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    Very often, <strong>this content is classified as restricted</strong> by both artificial intelligence and human verification, <strong>implicating that it is inappropriate</strong>.

    It’s already been proved that <strong>breastfeeding can reduce neonatal mortality</strong>. Motherly can connect moms who are struggling with breastfeeding and ensure that they receive the necessary support.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    Within my circle of influence <strong>I can enable connections between women to improve breastfeeding practices</strong> making them expand their support network.
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <strong>A mother that receives help through the platform can volunteer and help others</strong>. Finally, the mothers can connect their own circle of influence to help others.
